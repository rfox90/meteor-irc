## Meteor Irc

[node-irc](https://github.com/martynsmith/node-irc) wrapped in a modern way for use in Meteor.

## Why?

All the other packages that claim to wrap this module are out of data and closed source/missing github links.

I like knowing openly which version of an npm module a wrapper is providing. Especially so I can nag the developer when they don't update it to a new NPM version.
